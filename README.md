## About

This is a BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy) library for ESP32 that enables emulating a **mouse**, **keyboard**, or **combo HID device** — useful for projects requiring wireless HID input via ESP32.

## Features

- BLE-based HID support: mouse, keyboard, and combo (mouse + keyboard)  
- Easy-to-use API for sending mouse movements, clicks, keyboard keypresses  
- Compact C++ implementation compatible with ESP32 toolchains  
- Configurable HID descriptors via `HIDDescriptors.h`

## Getting Started

### Requirements

- ESP32 development board  
- Arduino-ESP32 core (or other ESP32-compatible build environment)  
- BLE support enabled

### Installation

1. Clone the repo  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/LegedsDaD/New-BLE-Library-for-ESP32-Mouse-and-Keyboard-and-Combo.git
